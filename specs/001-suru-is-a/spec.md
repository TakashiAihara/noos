# Feature Specification: Suru Task Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-suru-is-a`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "suru is a task management app. It's available on mobile and web, and it has a basic system to start with."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

- Q: 認証方式は何を使用しますか？ → A: OAuth（Google, GitHub等）のみ
- Q: チーム機能のサポートは必要ですか？ → A: チーム/プロジェクトでタスクをグループ化
- Q: オフライン機能は必要ですか？ → A: 不要（常時オンライン接続が必要）
- Q: 通知機能の要件は何ですか？ → A: フル通知（プッシュ通知、期限リマインダー、アサイン通知）
- Q: フィルタリング/ソート機能の具体的な要件は何ですか？ → A: フルテキスト検索も含む包括的なフィルタリング

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Users need a task management system accessible from both mobile devices and web browsers to organize, track, and manage their tasks efficiently across different platforms with synchronized data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has created a task on the web application, **When** they open the mobile app, **Then** they should see the same task synchronized across platforms
2. **Given** a user is viewing their task list, **When** they create a new task, **Then** the task should be saved and appear in the task list immediately
3. **Given** a user has multiple tasks, **When** they update a task's status, **Then** the change should be reflected in real-time on all connected devices
4. **Given** a user wants to organize work, **When** they access the system from mobile or web, **Then** they should have the same core task management capabilities

### Edge Cases
- How does the system handle conflicts when the same task is edited simultaneously on mobile and web?
- What happens when network connectivity is lost during an operation?
- How does the system behave when a user tries to access tasks with expired authentication?
- What happens when a user attempts to assign a task to someone not in the project's team?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create tasks with title, description, status, due date, priority, tags, assignee, and support for subtasks
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to view their task list on both web and mobile platforms
- **FR-003**: System MUST synchronize tasks across web and mobile platforms
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to update task information
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to delete tasks
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist tasks between sessions
- **FR-007**: System MUST authenticate users via OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
- **FR-008**: System MUST support team workspaces where multiple users can collaborate
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow tasks to be organized into projects, with each project belonging to a team
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide comprehensive filtering and sorting capabilities including:
  - Filter by: status, assignee, priority, tags, due date range, creation date
  - Sort by: due date, priority, creation date, last updated, title (alphabetical)
  - Full-text search across task titles and descriptions
  - Ability to save custom filter combinations for quick access
- **FR-011**: System MUST require active internet connection for all operations
- **FR-012**: System MUST send push notifications to mobile devices and web browsers for task assignments
- **FR-013**: System MUST send reminder notifications before task due dates
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide in-app notifications for task updates and mentions

### Key Entities
- **Task**: Represents a unit of work to be completed, with attributes: title (required), description (optional), status (enum: todo/in-progress/done), due date (optional), priority (enum: low/medium/high), tags (list), assignee (User reference), and subtasks (hierarchical Task references)
- **User**: Represents a person using the task management system, with profile information (name, email, avatar) and team memberships
- **Team**: Represents a group of users collaborating together, with team name and member list
- **Project**: Represents a collection of related tasks within a team, with project name and team reference
- **Tag**: Simple text labels that can be applied to tasks for flexible categorization
