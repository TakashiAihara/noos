# Noos Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence

Every line of code must meet professional standards for maintainability,
readability, and reliability. All code MUST follow TypeScript strict mode
with no implicit any types. Code MUST be formatted with Biome and pass
all ESLint rules. Functions MUST be pure where possible, with side effects
isolated and clearly documented. Maximum function complexity (cyclomatic)
MUST not exceed 10. All public APIs MUST have JSDoc documentation.

**Rationale**: High code quality reduces technical debt, prevents bugs,
and enables long-term maintainability across the monorepo structure.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Tests MUST be written before implementation following Red-Green-Refactor
cycle. Unit test coverage MUST maintain minimum 80% for all packages.
Integration tests MUST cover all API endpoints and service interactions.
Contract tests MUST validate all external interfaces. Performance tests
MUST validate response times under load. Tests MUST run in CI/CD pipeline
and block merges on failure.

**Rationale**: TDD ensures code correctness, prevents regressions, and
provides living documentation of system behavior. This is critical for
a microservices architecture where service contracts must be reliable.

### III. User Experience Consistency

All user interfaces MUST follow unified design patterns across Meguru,
Yomu, and Suru systems. Response times MUST be under 200ms for p95
requests. Error messages MUST be actionable and user-friendly. All
user actions MUST provide immediate feedback. Accessibility standards
(WCAG 2.1 AA) MUST be met for all interfaces. API responses MUST follow
consistent schema patterns across all services.

**Rationale**: Consistent UX across the monorepo's multiple systems
ensures users have a predictable, performant experience regardless of
which subsystem they interact with.

### IV. Performance Requirements

Services MUST handle 1000 concurrent requests without degradation.
Database queries MUST complete within 50ms for p95. Memory usage MUST
not exceed 512MB per service instance. Build times MUST stay under 2
minutes for full monorepo. Bundle sizes MUST stay under 200KB gzipped
for frontend applications. Caching strategies MUST be implemented for
all read-heavy operations using Valkey.

**Rationale**: Performance is critical for user satisfaction and system
scalability, especially in a microservices architecture where latency
can compound across service boundaries.

## Development Standards

### Technology Alignment
- TypeScript for all application code
- Hono for API services, React for frontends
- PostgreSQL with Prisma/Drizzle for persistence
- Valkey for caching, Apache Pulsar for messaging
- Turborepo for monorepo orchestration
- pnpm for dependency management

### Code Organization
- Feature-based module structure within each app
- Shared packages in /packages for cross-app code
- Service boundaries clearly defined and documented
- No circular dependencies between packages
- Maximum file size of 300 lines

### Security Requirements
- All inputs MUST be validated and sanitized
- Authentication required for all non-public endpoints
- Secrets MUST use environment variables, never committed
- Dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities weekly
- CORS properly configured for each service

## Review Process

### Pull Request Requirements
- At least one approval required before merge
- All tests passing (unit, integration, contract)
- Code coverage maintained or improved
- No ESLint warnings or errors
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation updated for API changes

### Quality Gates
- Automated checks via GitHub Actions
- Manual review for architecture changes
- Performance regression tests
- Security scanning on all changes
- Accessibility validation for UI changes

## Governance

### Amendment Process
Constitution changes require:
1. Documented rationale for change
2. Impact analysis on existing code
3. Migration plan if breaking changes
4. Team consensus (majority approval)
5. Version increment following semantic versioning

### Versioning Policy
- MAJOR: Removal of principles or backward-incompatible changes
- MINOR: New principles or significant expansions
- PATCH: Clarifications and minor refinements

### Compliance
- All code reviews MUST verify constitution compliance
- Quarterly audits of codebase against principles
- Violations documented with remediation timeline
- Exceptions require explicit justification and approval

### Runtime Guidance
Development guidance maintained in:
- `/CLAUDE.md` for AI pair programming context
- `/README.md` for project overview
- `/docs/` for detailed documentation
- `/.specify/` for specification templates
